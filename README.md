# Forward by Arietta Goshtasby, Founder of Therabot

Hi! Welcome to the repository for my first app, Therabot. 
Enclosed in this repo are the messy lines of code that create this program.
Yes, each line may not be formatted or commented perfectly.
But life is imperfect. And this is what it took to get me here.
This is the work of many, many months and many, many days of my summer spent inside.
Please enjoy.
-Arietta
